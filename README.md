## Ceddix's Personal Website _(ceddix-website)_

#### Hi, i'm Cedrik! I am a 15 y/o student from Belgium who spends his freetime here on the Internet.

Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, PHP, CSS & HTML and [my personal website](https://ceddix.de) is one of my **first projects**.

Of course, this website is still _under construction_ and will continue to evolve.

I love this great first project and am very grateful to [@J0schlZ](https://github.com/J0schlZ) for his support.
